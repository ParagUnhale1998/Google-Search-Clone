Hello, everyone! My name is Parag. Recently, I created this amazing Google Search clone using Angular and Tailwind CSS with the Google API.

## Features

- **Home Page:** Similar to the Google homepage, featuring an input field for search.
- **Search Results:** When you type a query (e.g., "John Cena") and hit enter, you navigate to the search results page.
- **Navigation Bar:** Includes a logo, an input field for search, icons, and a small profile image on the right.
- **Tabs:** Three tabs available - All, Images, and Videos.

### All Tab
- **Results:** Displays 10 results per page.
- **Show More Button:** Click to load 10 more results.
- **Link Tabs:** Titles and descriptions of search results.
- **Details Section:** Information about the search item such as name, website, images, description, birthdate, and more.

### Images Tab
- **Loading:** Displays 10 images with awesome loading effects.

### Videos Tab
- **Video Links:** Displays 10 video links with images and names.
- **Navigation:** Click a link to navigate to the YouTube video page.
